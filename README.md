# str-manipulation
This simple side project was made by me to review the content in the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) at the end of [Chapter 4](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html). This project was aimed to practice the concepts of ownership, references and borrowing, and slices. 

To do this, I decided to include 3 features. The first is the ability to concatenate 5 different strings together. The second is the ability to find the length of a string. And the thrid is the ability to split a string in to 2 parts at a point defined by the user. All of the strings in this script are given by the user.

To use just use [rustc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/) or [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) to build or run.

I hope you find this code and repository useful, thank you.
